## ⚠️ FINAL STEP NEEDED (1 minute)

The Railway CLI uploaded the code, but the service needs to be linked via the dashboard.

### Option A: Check if Already Deployed
1. **Open Railway Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://railway.com/project/5c0442ff-56fc-49b1-9634-481f81a574f1
   ```

2. **Check for active deployments:**
   - Look for a service with build logs
   - If you see "Building" or "Deploying", just wait 1-2 minutes
   - If successful, the URL will work: https://svg-vectorizer-pro-production.up.railway.app

### Option B: Connect GitHub Repo (Recommended)
If no deployment is running:

1. **In Railway Dashboard, click "+ New Service"**

2. **Select "GitHub Repo"**

3. **Choose: yassinenaimi343-netizen/svg-vectorizer-pro**

4. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect Node.js
   - Run `pnpm install`
   - Run `pnpm build`
   - Start the server
   - Deploy to: https://svg-vectorizer-pro-production.up.railway.app

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the build to complete
